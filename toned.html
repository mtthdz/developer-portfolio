        Toned is an online and print magazine that centers around celebrating and empowering Black Canadians. The magazine
        explores topics at the intersection of race, art and culture.
      </p>

      <p class="highlighted__paragraph">
        Fellow developer Kay Evans-Stocks and I determined the technical direction that Toned should take with its website, as
        well as its design, implementation, and transition.
      </p>

      <p class="highlighted__paragraph">
        Being in its first steps as a business, determining the right technical solution for Toned's website meant addressing
        the ability to scale and transition the platform. We determined that Wordpress would be a suitable content management
        system that could address the scalability and transition concerns. The CMS provides a large degree of customization, as
        well as ease of use when considering the "hand off" of responsibilities. More notably, Wordpress enables the use of an
        e-commerce platform, be it within the Wordpress ecosystem or with an external provider. Lastly, Wordpress provides the
        opportunity to transition its CMS solution into a headless CMS alternative, should the team consider this essential to
        its roadmap.
      </p>

      <p class="highlighted__paragraph">
        We worked hand-in-hand with Toned founder Jode-Leigh on UX and UI design, utilizing Adobe XD to map out the website and
        visualize the interface design. Kay and I combined our design expertise with Jode-Leigh's vision and current online
        presence, using large imagery and traditional serif fonts to create a modern, print-themed style. Wordpress' wide array
        of customizable themes made developing our envisioned design seamless.
